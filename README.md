# Nuclear Earth Mod

This mod is specifically developed for use in the Nuclear Earth Reirradiated modpack. It may cause issues elsewhere.

Balancing changes were made specifically with NER in mind.

# Changes

1. Petrified and Pitiful fuel generators have their power generation rate capped at 40 and 20 respectively.
2. NuclearCraft underhaul's hazmat armor takes damage when exposed to chunk radiation.

# Fixes
1. Patches the fusion reactor not caring about item counts.
2. Fixes the centrifuge not handling nbt properly and causing a dupe-loop.

# Known Issues

This mod will not work correctly when using NuclearCraft Overhauled.
