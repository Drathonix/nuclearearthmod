# Nuclear Earth Mod

A mod specifically made for my modpack: Nuclear Earth Reirradiated

This mod makes mixin modifications to other mods to either patch or balance them.

# Modifications:
### Nuclearcraft
* Hazmat Armor has a radiationlevel/3 chance to take 1 damage each radiation tick. Damage is guaranteed when radiationlevel > 1.
### Tech Reborn
* Fusion reactor works perfectly regardless of item order, previously this would break with recipes consuming more than one item.
* The Industrial Centrifuge cares about NBT. This would misidentify empty cells as lava cells.
### Industrial Foregoing
* Maximizes Petrified Fuel generator output at 40rf/t and Pitiful Fuel generator RF output at 20rf/t.
